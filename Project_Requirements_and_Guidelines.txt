1. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
------------------------
- The purpose of this document is to ensure quality and compliance with specific requirements, including Joomla development standards, coding guidelines, and industry best practices.
- It establishes a framework for clear collaboration and high-quality deliverables.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
2.1 Compliance with Standards:  
- All development work must adhere to Joomla’s official coding standards and guidelines as outlined in:  
  - Joomla Coding Standards (https://docs.joomla.org/Joomla_Coding_Standards)  
  - Joomla Framework Documentation (https://joomla.github.io/coding-standards/)  
- The use of Joomla’s native APIs, MVC structure, and language file support is mandatory for consistency and compatibility.

2.2 Recommendations and Specifications:  
- The project-specific work description and this document complement each other. In case of conflicting requirements, the following priority applies:  
  1. Project-specific work description.  
  2. This document, including linked references.

2.3 Code and Quality:  
- Code must be well-structured, self-explanatory where possible (e.g., use meaningful variable names, functions, and comments to explain non-obvious logic).  
- Unsupported or deprecated libraries and components should not be used unless explicitly approved.  
- Third-party extensions or libraries must be vetted for quality, support, and compatibility with Joomla’s ecosystem.

2.4 Joomla Overrides
- Use Joomla Overrides wherever possible to ensure system upgradeability and prevent losing customizations during Joomla updates.
- Overrides should be placed in the `templates/[your-template]/html/` folder, not directly in the core or core components, to maintain Joomla's upgradeability.
- When creating custom views (views) for components or modules, use Overrides rather than modifying the original component code.
- Overrides should be well-documented with comments explaining why the change is needed, including any external libraries or customizations required.

2.5 Compatibility and Upgrade-Friendliness
- All customizations must be upgrade-friendly. Ensure any changes made to core files or components, which cannot be avoided, are well-documented and tested to avoid problems during future Joomla or third-party component updates.
- In addition to Overrides, custom modules and components should be coded in a way that they can be easily updated or replaced without altering the core structure of Joomla.

2.6 CSS and Styling Guidelines
- All CSS should be written according to Joomla's best practices for styling and templates.
- Custom styles should be placed in the template’s CSS files, not in core component or module files, to maintain flexibility during Joomla updates.
- Ensure that CSS does not override Joomla's default styles unless absolutely necessary. Use more specific selectors to prevent conflicts.
- Avoid using inline styles; instead, use external CSS files or style overrides in the template.

2.7 File Structure for CSS and Media
- Custom CSS should be added in the template’s `templates/[your-template]/css/` directory.
- Media files such as images, fonts, or JavaScript libraries should be stored in appropriate directories (`images/`, `media/`, etc.) under the template folder, not in Joomla's core directories.

3. DOCUMENTATION
----------------

3.1 Project Setup and Workflow  
- The project owner (Emil Appelkvist) creates a private GitHub repository and invites the worker/developer/programmer to collaborate.  
- All project files must be managed within the GitHub repository.  
- Work should be committed and pushed to GitHub regularly, with clear and concise commit messages.  
- A `development` branch will be used for ongoing work, while the `main` branch will contain the stable, production-ready code. Pull requests (PRs) must be used for merging any changes to the `main` branch.

3.2 Branching and Commits  
- The worker/developer/programmer should create feature branches for individual tasks and commit changes to those branches.  
- All commits should follow the format:  
  - A brief message describing the change.  
  - Reference the related issue (e.g., "Fixes #123").  
  - A detailed explanation if necessary (for complex changes).  
- Do not commit directly to the `main` or `development` branches.

3.3 Pull Requests and Review  
- Pull requests (PRs) are used to merge changes into the `main` branch. PRs should be reviewed by the project owner (Emil Appelkvist) for approval before merging.  
- All changes must be well-documented, tested, and pass quality checks (including automated tests) before being merged.

3.4 Issue Tracking  
- All bugs and issues must be documented in GitHub Issues.  
- Each issue should have a clear description, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and be assigned to the appropriate developer.

3.5 GitHub Guidelines  
- Follow the GitHub Guides and best practices for branching, commits, and pull requests:  
    - GitHub Flow: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/  
    - GitHub Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/github

To ensure all requirements are met, all work will be reviewed by a quality expert.

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE

4.1 Testing:  
- The worker/developer/programmer is responsible for creating and executing a test plan. All tests should be documented and automated where possible.  
- Testing should cover functional, integration, and user acceptance tests.

4.2 Bug Management:  
- Bugs found during testing should be documented in GitHub Issues and assigned to the relevant developer for resolution.

5. POINTS OF CONTACT
--------------------
- Communication must be in English or Swedish.  
- Key questions and reporting should be logged in the issue management system.
- General discussions may take place via Freelancer.com, Skype, or another agreed-upon platform.

6. PAYMENTS
-----------
- Payments will be made according to the agreement.  
- Work is subject to review, and payment will only be issued once the work has been approved. A quality expert may assist in the review.

7. WARRANTY AND RESPONSIBILITY
------------------------------
- The developer guarantees a bug-free product.  
- Any bugs or errors discovered within the warranty period (6 months) must be resolved at no additional cost.

8. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
---------------------------
- The developer must accept and adhere to the terms of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) provided in a separate document or contract.

9. OWNERSHIP
------------
- All intellectual property created as part of the project belongs solely to the client.  
- All files must include the following metadata:

/*
* @version        x.X.X
* @copyright      Emil Appelkvist, Nyköping, Sweden
* @owner          Emil Appelkvist, Nyköping, Sweden
* @author         [Developer Name], [Company], [Email]
* @license        Proprietary software
*/

10. TIME AND REPORTING
----------------------
10.1 Timeline:  
- Project deadlines and milestones will be defined in the project-specific work description.  
- Delays must be communicated promptly, and new timelines agreed upon if needed.

10.2 Reporting:  
- The developer must submit regular reports (e.g., every Tuesday and Friday), including:  
  - Work completed since the last report.  
  - Total hours spent on the project (if payment is hourly).  
  - Questions requiring urgent answers.  
  - Next steps and any blockers.
